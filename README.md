# What is this repo?
MagnetMagnet is a scraper that allows you to scrape magnet links from RARBG. I decided to make this app to improve my Python skills.

## Features supported:
- Scraping magnet links from all RARBG mirrors
- Ability to choose multiple categories/subcategories to scrape magnet links from
- Copies magnet links to clipboard
- Exports magnet links into .txt file

## How to use:
### Installing:
- To install MagnetMagnet either download the executable file from [here](https://github.com/eliasbenb/MagnetMagnet/releases)
- Or you can download the python file above and run it using python (make sure to install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file)
### Usage:
- There are only three user changeable fields in MagnetMagnet:

- Domain: the first field is for the domain, here just input any RARBG domain name. I reccomend https://rarbg.to/ as of 2020
- Category Number: the second field is for the category number. This must be entered as a number ID. Multiple IDs can be inputed at once when seperated by a semi colon ';'. **All the category IDs can be found below**
- Clipboard: this is the third field and is a yes or no option, this just copies the magnet links to your clipboard
